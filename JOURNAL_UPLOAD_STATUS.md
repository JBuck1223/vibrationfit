# Journal Upload Status - 35MB Video

## ‚úÖ What's Working
- Upload succeeded via presigned URL
- File is in S3
- File shows in journal entry
- No 413 errors (fixed!)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Not Working
- MediaConvert job not triggered
- File playing? (Check your iPhone)

## üîç Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Console Logs
When you uploaded, did you see:
- "üé¨ Triggering MediaConvert for presigned upload"
- "‚úÖ MediaConvert job triggered"

If NOT, the trigger code isn't running.

### 2. Check AWS MediaConvert
Go to AWS Console ‚Üí MediaConvert
- Any jobs created?
- Check for jobs from last 10 minutes

### 3. Current File Location
Your video should be at:
```
user-uploads/720adebb-e6c0-4f6c-a5fc-164d128e083a/journal/uploads/[timestamp]-[random]-[filename]
```

## Next Steps

### Option A: Test if Video Plays
- If it plays: Problem solved! (no MediaConvert needed yet)
- If it doesn't play: We need to debug

### Option B: Check AWS Console
Go to MediaConvert and see if ANY jobs exist from the last hour.

Let me know what you find!
