    "romance_partnership_story": "My wife is epic! She is the best thing ever and we have an awesome marriage, partnership, and team atmosphere in the house. We work together on our business and life - pursuing common goals we decide on mutually together. I'd like to do more one on one stuff with her, right now we mostly spend our free time on work or with the kids.",
    "family_parenting_story": "I'm a great dad. My kids are awesome and they love me. We have a lot of fun on adventures.",
    "career_work_story": "I run a business that pays my wife and I over $200,000/year called Buckingham Enterprises, Inc. While I actively run it, I also have aspirations of building a thriving membership platform at VibrationFit.com that helps people Consciously Create their best life.",
    "money_wealth_story": "I have been making over $200,000/year for over 5 years with my wife in our own business. Right now, I feel a bit stuck there. I know it's a good income, but I'd like to break out into another income category, like $1,000,000.00/year. We have great financial resources, good equity in our home, and minimal debt - less than $10,000 at less than 1% interest. I'd like to begin building a more dynamic asset base as our income grows - potentially owning property outside of our main residence. We also have most of our income coming during an 8 month period between April and November, with December through January being much lighter. I feel a bit like a squirrel saving nuts for winter sometimes. I'd like our income to be dynamic year round. I used to save much better when it was just my wife and me, but now it feels like I spend a lot of what we make with little left at the end of the month for investments, etc. Cash feels slower accumulating than it did before the kids and the house.",
    "home_environment_story": "We have a beautiful 3561 sq ft house in a luxurious area of Florida. We have a great backyard and a preserve/pond view that's really nice. I'd like to do a backyard project where I improve it with a patio and a hot tub, but it hasn't felt like the right time to drop that cash with cash building slower lately. Inside is nice and very kid friendly. It lives really well with 5 bedrooms + office + bonus room. We have walk-in closets in every room. I would like to improve the main living and kitchen area with a bit more of a luxury feel, but again it hasn't felt like the right time, especially with the kids being kinda messy in there frequently.",
    "health_vitality_story": "I'm a strong fit dad that keeps up with his kids pretty well. I hang around 16 to 18% body fat percentage and struggle with knocking that down further to feel like a really cut super dad. So I would like to be more cut and eat the foods I like and keep up with my smoking hot wife.",
    "fun_recreation_story": "We have a lot of fun as a family! We go on boats, fish, take golf cart rides to parks, go to amusement parks, and more!\n\n--- Recorded on 10/23/2025 (Audio saved) ---\nAlright, I am testing this on mobile just to see how it goes. Yesterday we went golf cart fishing as a family. Got a rocking fishing pole holder on the back and caught a little tiny bass in a pond over by the office. It was super fun.",
    "travel_adventure_story": "I really enjoy traveling now. We have three kids. So it's a little bit more intense getting out the door and traveling to Different locations if it takes like You know an airplane ride and Airbnb and car rental and all that Mainly just because we've got car seats and stuff, you know out the wazoo because our kids are six four and one so I've got a lot of like aspirations to travel and there are a lot of really cool things I want to see in the world, but at the same time it's a bit of a challenge with expense and just the sheer Volume of work that it is to get out the door with the kids. So, some of the places I'd like to visit are Thailand the Asian countries like China.

    "social_friends_story": "At this point, I'd say my social life is pretty good. I've got some really great friends. Our best friends also have three children like us, so, you know, getting together with 10 people with all the schedules that we have now can be a little bit intense. But I also have really great friends that I speak to on the phone, but they don't live close. So, one of my best buddies up in Maine is named Jake. I talk to him a good bit, but we don't get to hang out a lot, obviously, because he doesn't live by me. I live in Florida. So, I would say I've got some really good friends that I connect with over the phone and got a few cool people that are around where I live. But most of the time, we're just kind of hanging out as a family unit. So, I'd say my best friend is my wife, and my most time spent is with my family.",
    "possessions_lifestyle_story": "We definitely have a lot of stuff which is cool. I'm kind of utilitarian on stuff like I like to have things that are useful and Help us go on adventures and do cool stuff like that. So right now I'm driving a 2022 Honda Odyssey, it's awesome.

Fortunately my wife is the same way so we're definitely on the chill spiritual bandwagon where we're just trying to love ourselves and allow more of source energy into our reality. So really cool. We don't have a lot of conflict around that we just have a lot of peace and knowing and so I feel like my relationship with my inner being is really good and I listen and I pay attention to my emotional guidance system and I live a really great life in that category.",
