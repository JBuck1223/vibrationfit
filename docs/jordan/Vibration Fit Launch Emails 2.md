**Assumption:**

* **Offer \= “72-Hour Activation Intensive” \+ 8 weeks of Vibration Fit membership starting the day they buy.**  
* **Normal price \= $499, test group price \= $1 as a founding tester style free trial.** \[$100M Money Models, Page 151\]

**Here’s exactly what I’d send.**  
---

### **Email to friends & family**

Subject (pick one):

* “Founding test group: 72‑Hour Activation Intensive for $1”  
* “Want to test our 72‑Hour Activation Intensive for $1?”

Body:

Hey \[Name\],

Our Vibration Fit platform is finally ready, and we’re opening our first 72‑Hour Activation Intensive to a tiny “friends & family” test group.

We’d love for you to be part of it.

Here’s the deal:

* You get our full 72‑Hour Activation Intensive  
* Plus 8 weeks of Vibration Fit membership, starting the day you join  
* Regular price will be $499  
* You get it as a founding tester for $1

Why $1?

Because this round is about testing and improving, not making money. I want honest feedback, bug reports, and (if it genuinely helps you) a testimonial we can use when we launch publicly.

What the 72‑Hour Activation Intensive is about:

* Getting crystal clear on your vision for your life  
* Getting into vibrational harmony with that vision  
* Starting to turn that vision into real, tangible experiences

What I ask from you:

* Go through the 72‑hour experience sometime in the next \[X\] days  
* Tell us what you loved, what was confusing, and what you’d change  
* If it helps you, be open to sharing a short written or video testimonial

If you’re in, grab your spot for $1 here: https://vibrationfit.com/?promo=intensive2025

We’re only taking about 15–20 people, and your 8 weeks of membership starts the day you sign up.

Thank you for helping us get this into the world,  
\[Your Name\]  
---

### **Text message flow**

Initial text:

*Hey\! We just finished building our Vibration Fit platform and I’m running a tiny “friends & family” test of our 72‑Hour Activation Intensive. It’ll be $499 when we launch, but I’m giving this first round for $1, and it also includes 8 weeks of membership starting when you join.All I’m asking for is honest feedback (and a testimonial if you love it). Want me to send you the link?*

If they say  yes:  
*Amazing, thank you\! Here’s the $1 founding tester link for the 72‑Hour Activation Intensive \+ 8 weeks of membership: https://vibrationfit.com/?promo=intensive2025*

*We’re only taking about 15–20 people in this first round, so grab it when you can.*  
That’s it. One clear email, one clear text. Then your real work starts: make these 15–20 people win so hard that their stories do the selling for you later.

---

**Assumption:**  
**They paid $1 for the 72‑Hour Activation Intensive \+ 8 weeks. On Day 56 their plan renews into Vision Pro Annual at $999/year (or whatever plan you set at checkout).**

Here’s the email I’d use:

**Subject: Quick heads up about your Vibration Fit membership**

Hey \[First Name\],

Quick heads up so there are no surprises.

When you joined the 72‑Hour Activation Intensive, you also unlocked 8 weeks of Vision Pro membership as part of that $1 founding tester offer.

On \[DATE\], your membership is set to renew into Vision Pro Annual at $999 for 12 months (billed once, then locked in for the year).

That renewal includes:

Full access to the Vision Builder and all creation tools  
Unlimited vision boards, audios, journaling, and progress tracking  
Your satisfaction guarantee window from the membership terms  
Priority access to new features and future activations  
If you’re loving the platform and want to stay on your journey with us, you don’t need to do anything. Your membership will renew automatically on \[DATE\], and your rate will be locked in for the year.

If you don’t want to continue, no hard feelings at all.  
You can cancel any time before \[DATE\] here:  
\[Manage / cancel link\]

I’d much rather be overly clear now than have you feel surprised later. If you have any questions about what’s included, or want help deciding whether to stay, just hit reply and I’ll walk you through it.

Thank you again for being part of the first group inside Vibration Fit. You helped us bring this to life.

With much appreciation,  
\[Your Name\]

Optional short text 3–5 days before:

Hey \[Name\], quick reminder: your Vibration Fit Vision Pro membership is set to renew on \[DATE\] at $999 for 12 months. If you’re loving it, you’re all set. If you’d rather cancel before it renews, you can do that here: \[link\]. Just want to make sure there are no surprises.

This does three things:

Re‑anchors the value of what they’re getting.  
Makes you look fair and transparent, which lowers chargeback risk.  
Gives them a clear, easy action whether they stay or leave.

**2\. Orientation / Expectations Email (within 1 hour)**  
Goal: Frame the journey and reduce buyer’s remorse.

What the 72‑Hour Activation Intensive is, what “success” looks like.  
Simple checklist: “Do these 3 things in the next 24 hours.”  
Reassure: $1 as founding tester, what happens after 8 weeks.

**Subject: What to expect inside your Activation Intensive**  
Pre-header: What “success” looks like, 3 things to do today, and your $1 Founding Tester details.

Pill badge: ORIENTATION  
Headline: Here’s how this works

Hi {{firstName}},

You’re inside the 72‑Hour Activation Intensive. Here’s what that actually means and what to focus on first.

What you’re building  
The Intensive is a 14‑step guided path. By the end, you’ll have:

Your Life Vision written across 12 categories, built with VIVA  
A personalized Activation Audio (morning \+ evening)  
A Vision Board with images for each category  
Your first Conscious Creation Journal entry  
A live Calibration Call booked  
A 28‑Day Activation Plan to make it your daily rhythm  
That’s what “done” looks like. Not “I read about it.” You’ll have a living system drafted, recorded, visualized, and scheduled.

Your first 24 hours: 3 things  
Log in and set your password  
If you haven’t already, this takes 30 seconds.  
Log in →

Start your Intensive  
Click “Start My Activation Intensive” on your dashboard. This begins your 72‑hour focus window.

Complete Steps 1–4 (Account, Intake, Profile, Assessment)  
These are your foundation. Once your profile and Vibration Assessment are done, everything that follows – your Vision, your Audios, your Board – is built on what you share here.

Plan on one focused session (about 60–90 minutes) to knock these out.

Your $1 Founding Tester access  
You paid $1 today to verify your payment method. Here’s exactly what that means:

What you have right now:  
Full access to the 72‑Hour Activation Intensive \+ 8 weeks of Vision Pro. Same platform, same tools, same VIVA – nothing is held back.

What happens on Day 56:  
Your selected plan begins automatically:

Annual: $999/year (about $76.85 per 28‑day cycle)  
28‑Day: $99, renews every 28 days  
If you want to change or cancel:  
You can switch plans or cancel anytime before Day 56\. No charge beyond your $1. You can manage this from your Account Settings.

No surprises. No fine print.

**Day 3 Email – Activation \+ Completion**  
**Trigger:**

**Send X hours after they click “Start My Activation Intensive” and are on Day 3 (or simply at T+48 hours from start).**  
Subject: Today: Activate your vision & unlock your platform  
Pre-header: Finish your 72‑Hour Activation Intensive strong.

Hi {{firstName}},

You’re in the final stretch of your **72‑Hour Activation Intensive**.

By the end of today, you’ll have your vision **activated** and your full Vibration Fit platform **unlocked.**

**Today’s focus**  
Log into your dashboard and complete the last two phases:

1. **Activation (Steps 10–12)**  
* Vision Board  
* Journal Entry  
* Book Calibration Call  
2. **Completion (Steps 13–14)**  
* MAP (My Activation Plan)  
* **Unlock Platform**

\[Go to my next step →[https://vibrationfit.com/auth/login](https://vibrationfit.com/auth/login)\]

**What “Unlock Platform” actually does**

When you reach **Step 14 – Unlock Platform**, you’ll see:

* A **Journey Summary** with green checks across all 14 steps  
* An **Activation Snapshot** where you’ll quickly rate how things feel now vs when you started (the system shows your original baseline answers and what you’ve actually built: visions, audios, boards, etc.)  
* One final question: “**What feels most different for you?**”  
  * You can record a short video  
  * Or type your response instead  
* A simple choice on how we’re allowed to share your success (named, anonymous, or not at all)

When you click **Unlock Platform** at the bottom:

* Your Intensive is marked completed  
* Your main dashboard unlocks   
* You get the full Vibration Fit experience you’ve been working toward

This is your graduation moment.

**Why it matters**  
For you: it creates a clear **before/after snapshot** you can look back on when life changes start stacking.

For us: as a **$1 Founding Tester**, your answers and story are what help us improve the platform and help future members win. 

Give yourself one focused block today to complete through **Unlock Platform**. Don’t leave your story half‑written.

If anything on the final steps is confusing or broken, click the Support button while logged in (vibrationfit.com/support) and choose “**Bug Report**” so we can fix it fast.

You’ve come all this way. Finish the path and step into the platform you just built for your future self.

With you,

**4\. Intensive Debrief \+ Testimonial Ask (Day 4\) make it conditional**

The “Final step: unlock your platform & capture your results” email should:

Only send if:  
They clicked “Start My Activation Intensive”  
They’ve completed at least up through Step 13  
unlock\_completed \!= true  
It’s been \~12–24 hours since the Day 3 email (or \~60 hours since they started)  
In that context, the email isn’t redundant; it’s a win‑back for almost‑finishers.

**Subject: Final step: unlock your platform & capture your results**  
Pre‑header: 14 of 14: your before/after snapshot \+ sharing what shifted.

Hi {{firstName}},

I can see you’ve made it all the way through your **72‑Hour Activation Intensive**.

There’s one last step: **Unlock Platform**.

This is **Step 14 of 14**, and it does two things at once:

**1\. Captures your before/after**

You’ll answer a short set of questions so the system can compare your post‑intensive answers with your original Baseline Intake. You’ll literally see:

* How clear your vision feels now  
* How empowered you are to stay in vibrational harmony  
* How easy it is to create and update your vision, audios, and board  
* How clear your MAP feels

**2\. Graduates you & unlocks your full platform**

When you click **Unlock Platform** at the bottom:

Your Intensive is marked **completed**  
Your main dashboard unlocks  
You’ll see a celebration state and your full Vibration Fit experience opens up

\[Go to my Unlock Platform step → [https://vibrationfit.com/auth/login](https://vibrationfit.com/auth/login)\]

**What we’ll ask you**  
On the Unlock page you’ll see:

* A **Journey Summary** showing green checks across all 14 steps  
* An **Activation Snapshot** with 11 quick questions (most already pre‑scored based on what you’ve built)  
* One final question: “**What feels most different for you?**”  
  * You can record a short video (up to 3 minutes)  
  * Or type your response instead

This is your moment to describe, in your own words, what shifted – in clarity, confidence, or how you see and shape your life now. Specific stories and concrete changes are gold here. 

You’ll also choose how (or if) we can share your success:

* With first name  
* Anonymously  
* Or not at all

**Why this matters (especially as a $1 Founding Tester)**

Your Unlock step isn’t just for us.

* It gives **you** a clear “before vs after” snapshot you can look back on later.  
* It gives **us** the proof and insight we need to improve the platform and help more people. 

You paid $1 and did the work. Finish this last step so you leave with a complete story and a fully unlocked platform.

\[Complete Unlock Platform now → [https://vibrationfit.com/auth/login](https://vibrationfit.com/auth/login)\]

With deep appreciation for helping us build this,  
The Vibration Fit Team

*If anything on the Unlock page is confusing or broken, click the Support button or go to vibrationfit.com/support while you’re logged in and choose “Bug Report” so we can fix it fast.*

***Key: trigger this only if they haven’t completed Unlock after Day 3\. Then it’s not spam, it’s rescue.***

Good. You’re thinking like an adult business, not a side‑project. Fewer surprises \= fewer chargebacks and more trust.  
Given where you are (tiny founding group, $1 trial into membership), you don’t need 47 automations. You need a minimum viable lifecycle that:

1. Activates them,  
2. Keeps them using it,  
3. Makes billing obvious,  
4. Gives you a way to win them back.

Here’s the initial set I’d program.  
---

## **1\. Access / Login Email (immediately after $1 purchase)**

Goal: “I know what I bought and how to start.”

* Subject: “You’re in: 72‑Hour Activation Intensive access”  
* Includes: login link, how to reset password, start date / time framing, support contact.

---

## **2\. Orientation / Expectations Email (within 1 hour)**

Goal: Frame the journey and reduce buyer’s remorse.

* What the 72‑Hour Activation Intensive is, what “success” looks like.  
* Simple checklist: “Do these 3 things in the next 24 hours.”  
* Reassure: $1 as founding tester, what happens after 8 weeks.  
  \[$100M Playbook Retention, Page 35\]

---

## **3\. 72‑Hour Daily Guidance Emails (3 emails: Day 1, 2, 3\)**

Goal: Get them to actually do the intensive. Activation kills churn.  
Each email:

* “Today’s focus” (one clear task).  
* Direct link into the exact module.  
* Quick encouragement \+ reminder they’re helping you improve the platform.

---

## **4\. Post‑Intensive Debrief \+ Testimonial Ask (Day 4\)**

Goal: Lock in wins and get assets.

* Ask: “What shifted for you?”  
* Link to short feedback form.  
* Ask for written/video testimonial if it truly helped.  
* Preview: “Over the next 7+ weeks, here’s how to keep building on this…”

\[$100M Playbook Lifetime Value, Page 16\]

---

## **5\. Weekly “Usage & Wins” Email (Weeks 2–8)**

Goal: Keep them logging in so renewal feels obvious, not random.  
Each week:

* One featured practice / feature to use.  
* A tiny “win story” from someone (even anonymized for now).  
* Reminder of the bigger promise: vision → vibration → real‑world outcomes.

---

## **6\. Pre‑Renewal Reminder Emails (3 total)**

Goal: Zero surprise charges. Lower chargebacks.

* 7 days before: “Here’s what you’ve unlocked so far & what’s coming if you stay.”  
* 3 days before: Clear reminder of date \+ price \+ how to manage/cancel.  
* 1 day before: Final polite heads‑up.

Mirror the 3‑day and 1‑day as SMS too. Short, factual, with a manage link.  
\[$100M Playbook Retention, Page 35\]  
---

## **7\. Renewal Confirmation / Receipt**

Goal: Close the loop and reduce refund fights.

* “Your membership renewed today” \+ amount \+ next billing date.  
* Re‑anchor value and next milestones.

---

## **8\. Failed Payment / Card Update Emails (Dunning)**

Goal: Save revenue you already earned.

* Attempt 1: Friendly “card issue, here’s a one‑click update link.”  
* Attempt 2–3: Slight urgency: “We’ll pause access on \[DATE\] if not updated.”

---

## **9\. Cancellation & Winback Emails**

a) Cancellation confirmation

* “You’re canceled effective X. Here’s what you’ll lose.”  
* One link to quick exit survey.

b) Winback (30–60 days later)

* “We’ve improved X/Y/Z since you left, want to come back for \[irresistible but bounded\] deal?”

If you set these 9 buckets up cleanly, you’ve got a real system: onboarding, activation, engagement, billing clarity, and a path to get people back.  
You don’t need more right now. You need these sending, then you watch behavior and refine.

**6\. Pre‑Renewal Reminder Emails (3 total)**

**7‑DAY EMAIL – VALUE \+ WHAT’S NEXT**  
Subject: 7 days until your Vibration Fit membership renews  
Pre‑header: What you’ve unlocked so far, and what happens next.

Hi {{firstName}},

You’re coming up on the end of your 8‑week Founding Tester window inside Vibration Fit. I want to make sure you know exactly what happens next.

**What you’ve unlocked so far**

Over these last weeks, you’ve had access to:

* The **72‑Hour Activation Intensive**  
* Your Life Vision, Activation Audio, and Vision Board  
* Your 28‑Day Activation Plan and main dashboard  
* Ongoing access to Vision Pro tools to keep iterating your vision and vibration

**What happens in 7 days**

On \[RENEWAL\_DATE\], your membership is set to continue automatically:

* If you chose Annual: $999/year (billed once per year)  
* If you chose 28‑Day: $99 every 28 days

If you’re getting value and want to stay on your journey, you don’t need to do anything. Your membership will renew and your rate will be locked in.

If you want to **change plans or cancel before then**, you can do it anytime here:  
\[Manage my membership →\] (link to account / billing page)

No surprises. No fine print.

3‑DAY EMAIL – CLEAR REMINDER \+ OPTIONS  
Subject: 3‑day reminder: your Vibration Fit membership renewal  
Pre‑header: Date, amount, and how to change or cancel.

Hi {{firstName}},

Quick reminder so there are no surprises.

On \[RENEWAL\_DATE\] (in 3 days), your Vibration Fit membership is scheduled to renew:

**Plan:** {{plan\_name}}  
**Amount:** {{plan\_amount}}  
**Billing schedule:** {{plan\_schedule}} (e.g., “$999/year” or “$99 every 28 days”)  
If you’re loving the platform and want to continue, you’re all set. The renewal will process automatically and your access continues without interruption.

If you’d rather **change plans or cancel before it renews**, you can do that here:  
\[Manage my membership →\]

You’ve put real effort into activating your vision. Whether you stay or go, I want this to feel clean and transparent.

**1‑DAY EMAIL – FINAL POLITE HEADS‑UP**  
Subject: Tomorrow: your Vibration Fit membership renewal

Hi {{firstName}},

Final quick heads‑up:

Tomorrow, \[RENEWAL\_DATE\], your Vibration Fit membership is set to renew:

**Plan:** {{plan\_name}}  
**Amount:** {{plan\_amount}}  
If you’re continuing, you’re all set – nothing else to do.

If you **do not** want to continue, this is your last chance to change or cancel before the charge goes through:

**1‑DAY SMS:**

Final reminder: your Vibration Fit {{plan\_name}} renews tomorrow for {{plan\_amount}}.  
To change or cancel before it runs, visit: \[short manage link\]

*This keeps you 100 percent above-board, makes refunds/chargebacks hard to justify, and still re-sells the value right before the decision point. It’s exactly how I’d do it in any continuity model where I care about brand and LTV, not just short-term cash.*

**7\. Renewal Confirmation / Receipt**

You want this to feel: clear, fair, and like “of course I’m still in,” not “wait, what is this?”  
Here’s exactly how I’d write it.  
---

Subject: Your Vibration Fit membership renewed today  
Pre‑header: Receipt, next billing date, and what’s ahead.

Hi {{firstName}},

Your Vibration Fit membership renewed today. Here are the details for your records:

* Plan: {{plan\_name}}  
* Amount charged: {{plan\_amount}}  
* Billing schedule: {{plan\_schedule}} (e.g., “$999/year” or “$99 every 28 days”)  
* Next billing date: {{next\_billing\_date}}  
* Card ending in: {{card\_last4}}

You’ll also receive this as a receipt in your billing history.

### **What your membership includes**

With your membership active, you continue to have access to:

* Your Life Vision, Activation Audios, and Vision Board  
* Your MAP (My Activation Plan) and main dashboard  
* Access to the Vibe Tribe community  
* Weekly live coaching calls at the Alignment Gym   
* Tools to keep iterating your vision, vibration, and tracking transformations over time  
* Upcoming feature updates and future activations we roll out to members

This isn’t just access to software; it’s your environment for consciously creating and refining the life you’re moving toward.  
---

### **Need to update anything?**

You can **update your payment method, change plans, or cancel future renewals** anytime here:  
\[Manage my membership →\]

If anything about this charge looks off, or you have questions about your account, go to **vibrationfit.com/support** while you’re logged in and choose the most relevant category so we can help quickly.

This email does four jobs in one:

* Confirms the charge with specifics (amount, plan, next date, last4).  
* Re‑anchors what they’re getting so it doesn’t feel like a random fee.  
* Makes it easy to manage their account instead of charging back.  
* Shows you’re transparent and reachable, which kills a lot of “I felt tricked” energy before it starts.

---

**8\. Failed Payment / Card Update Emails (Dunning)**

You’re thinking correctly: dunning \= “save what you already earned,” not “sneak money.” You want 3 touches that go: friendly → clearer → firm but fair.  
Assumptions:

* Plan name/amount are dynamic (Annual $999 / 28‑Day $99).  
* Manage link \= vibrationfit.com/account (or similar).

### **Attempt 1 – Friendly, no-threat (immediately after fail)**

Subject: Quick fix: your Vibration Fit payment didn’t go through  
Pre‑header: Likely a card issue. Here’s a one‑click update link.  
Hi {{firstName}},  
Heads up: your recent Vibration Fit {{plan\_name}} payment for {{plan\_amount}} didn’t go through.

This usually happens because of:

* An expired card  
* A new card issued by your bank  
* A temporary bank hold

You still have full access right now. To keep everything running smoothly, please update your payment method here:  
\[Update my payment details →\]

It takes about 30 seconds and you’re done.

If you believe this is an error or need help, go to **vibrationfit.com/support** while you’re logged in and choose the most relevant category.

Thank you for continuing to build your vision with us,

### **Attempt 2 – Clearer, softer deadline (2–3 days after fail)**

Subject: Action needed to keep your Vibration Fit access  
Pre‑header: Your payment failed again. Update your card to avoid an access pause.

Hi {{firstName}},

We tried to process your Vibration Fit {{plan\_name}} payment for {{plan\_amount}} again, and it still didn’t go through.

To avoid any interruption to your access, please take a moment to update your payment details:

\[Update my payment details →\]

If the payment isn’t updated by \[PAUSE\_DATE\], we’ll need to temporarily pause your account until a valid payment method is on file.

If you’re intentionally trying to cancel or downgrade, you can manage your membership here instead:

\[Manage my membership →\]

And if something about this doesn’t look right, go to **vibrationfit.com/support** while you’re logged in so we can help.

With appreciation,  
The Vibration Fit Team

### **Attempt 3 – Firm, access pause date (right before pause)**

Subject: Final notice: your Vibration Fit access will pause on \[PAUSE\_DATE\]  
Pre‑header: Update your card to keep your membership active.

Hi {{firstName}},  
This is your final reminder about your Vibration Fit {{plan\_name}} payment for {{plan\_amount}}.

We still haven’t been able to process your payment. Unless you update your payment method, your account will be paused on \[PAUSE\_DATE\].

To keep your access active:

\[Update my payment details →\]

If you no longer wish to continue, you can also change plans or cancel here:  
\[Manage my membership →\]

If you think this is a mistake, or you need help, visit **vibrationfit.com/support** while you’re logged in and we’ll sort it out.

You can optionally add a short SMS on Attempt 2 or 3 like:

Vibration Fit: your {{plan\_name}} payment for {{plan\_amount}} failed. Update your card to avoid an access pause: \[short update link\]

This combo keeps you transparent, reasonable, and still protects the revenue you already sold.

**9\. Cancellation & Winback Emails**  
**a) Cancellation confirmation**  
**“You’re canceled effective X. Here’s what you’ll lose.”**  
**One link to quick exit survey.**

You want this to be: clear, final, respectful, and still leave the door open.  
Here’s how I’d write the cancellation confirmation email.

Subject: Your Vibration Fit membership has been canceled  
Pre‑header: Effective \[END\_DATE\]. Here’s what changes and how to share feedback.

Hi {{firstName}},

Your Vibration Fit {{plan\_name}} membership has been canceled effective \[END\_DATE\].

You’ll keep full access until that date. After \[END\_DATE\], you’ll lose access to:

* Your main Vibration Fit dashboard

### **Quick 30‑second exit check‑in**

If you’re open to it, I’d really appreciate hearing why you chose to cancel so we can improve the experience for future members.

\[Share quick feedback (30 seconds) →\]  
(link to a very short exit survey)

You can be blunt. The more honest you are, the more helpful it is.

### **If this was a mistake**

If you didn’t intend to cancel or change your mind, you can reactivate or change plans here:

\[Manage my membership →\]

If something looks off about this cancellation, go to **vibrationfit.com/support** while you’re logged in and choose the most relevant category so we can fix it.

This hits your goals:

* “You’re canceled effective X” in plain language.  
* Clear “here’s what you’ll lose” to make the consequence real (and reduce regret‑driven complaints).   
* One simple exit survey link to capture learnings and possible winbacks without being pushy.  
*
