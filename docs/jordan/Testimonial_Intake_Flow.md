**Initial Intake**:

Perfect adds. They map directly to core product behaviors (iterating vision + regenerating audios), which is exactly what you want to prove moves from hard → easy.

Here’s the updated **baseline survey** with your two questions integrated and the wording cleaned up:

1. On a scale 0–10, how clear is your vision for your life right now?  
2. On a scale 0–10, how often do you feel “in vibrational harmony” with that vision?  
3. On a scale 0–10, how clear is your current roadmap for how to activate your life vision in your day‑to‑day reality?  
4. On a scale 0–10, how easy is it for you to create new iterations of your life vision?  
5. On a scale 0–10, how easy is it for you to create new iterations of your life vision audios?  
6. On a scale 0–10, how well are you set up to track major life transformations over time?  
7. On a scale 0–10, how clear are you on your vibrational constraints?  
   *(If you don’t know what this means, put 0.)*  
8. Do you currently have audio tracks of your life vision?  
   - No  
   - Yes, but I rarely listen  
   - Yes, and I listen often  
9. On a scale 0–10, how easy is it for you to view and manage the items on your vision board?  
   *(Put 0 if you don’t have one.)*  
10. On a scale 0–10, how well are you capturing your conscious creation journey (thoughts, synchronicities, patterns) over time?  
11. What have you already tried to consciously create your dream life?  
12. Consent checkbox:  
    “I’m open to you using my feedback and results as anonymized or named testimonials once I approve them.”

Then for the **post‑Intensive survey**, you mirror questions 1–5, 6, 7, 9, 10 as new 0–10 scores.

That gives you homepage‑level proof like:

- “Ease of updating life vision: 2.1 → 8.4 in 72 hours.”  
- “Ease of updating vision audios: 1.3 → 8.0 in 72 hours.”

Which directly sells the software, not just the vibe.

**Calibration Call:**

You already built the data spine with the surveys. The live post‑Intensive meeting is where you wrap *story and emotion* around those numbers so the market actually cares.

Use the 6‑point testimonial script from the Marketing Machine, but anchor every section to one or more of your 0–10 metrics. [$100M Playbook Marketing Machine, Page 18]

Here’s the exact format.

---

## 0. Prep (you, before the call)

For each person, have one sheet open with:

- Baseline vs post‑Intensive scores for all the 0–10s  
- Any standout written answers (“rock bottom,” “tried X/Y/Z,” big synchronicities)

You’ll *quote* their numbers back to them on the call.

---

## 1. Open & hooks (2–3 minutes)

On camera, recorded, ask them to do this cleanly:

1) Identity + hook  
- “First, say: ‘My name is [Name], I’m a [short label: coach, creator, etc.], and before VibrationFit I was at a [X/10] on vision clarity.’”  
- Then: “Now say: ‘After 72 hours, my clarity went from [X/10] to [Y/10].’”

2) A few more hook lines (for ads) [$100M Playbook Marketing Machine, Page 19]  
Prompt:

- “Finish this: ‘If you’re someone who [big pain you had], you need to do the Activation Intensive because…’”  
- “One more: ‘I went from [state: guessing, scattered] to [state: dialed‑in, daily system] in 72 hours.’”

You can stop and have them re‑say these 2–3 times; these become ad openers.

---

## 2. BEFORE: internal + external struggle (4–5 minutes)

Use their metrics as anchors.

Internal struggle  
- “Take me back to before you started. What did a normal day feel like when your vision clarity was a [their baseline score]/10?”  
- “What was the hardest part about living in that state?”

External struggle (objective, tied to features) [$100M Playbook Marketing Machine, Page 18]  
Read a few numbers back:

- “You rated your roadmap to activate your vision at [X/10] and your tracking of transformations at [Y/10]. What did that *actually* look like in your life? Give me one example.”  
- “You put [0 or low] for vision board / journaling. How did that show up day‑to‑day?”

Keep pushing for specifics, not vagueness. [$100M Playbook Proof Checklist, Page 18]

---

## 3. Skepticism & decision (3–4 minutes)

- “What were your main hesitations or doubts about VibrationFit or the Activation Intensive?”  
- “What made you say ‘screw it, I’m doing this anyway’?”

This gives you the objection handling copy for ads and sales pages. [$100M Playbook Marketing Machine, Page 18]

---

## 4. DURING: what actually helped (3–4 minutes)

Tie to your core features:

- “Inside the 72 hours, what specifically helped you the most? VIVA prompts, vision writing, audios, journal, something else?”  
- “Was there a single moment or exercise where something really clicked? Describe that.”

You want them naming the product pieces in their own words.

---

## 5. AFTER: external victory (metrics) (4–5 minutes)

Now you marry the story back to the numbers.

Read their before/after:

- “You went from [clarity X/10 → Y/10], [roadmap A/10 → B/10], [constraints awareness C/10 → D/10]…”  
Then ask:

- “Which of those changes matters most to you, and why?”  
- “Give me one real‑world example of how your life feels different now that your roadmap is a [new score]/10.”  
- “What can you do now that you couldn’t or wouldn’t do before?”

This is your “external victory” section. [$100M Playbook Marketing Machine, Page 18]

---

## 6. AFTER: internal victory + best moment (3–4 minutes)

- “Emotionally, how do you feel now compared to before? Use your own words.”  
- “What’s been the single best moment since the Intensive?”  
- “Any cool synchronicities or ‘this can’t be a coincidence’ moments since you started running your protocol?”

Personal > generic; tease out vivid, weird, human details. [$100M Playbook Proof Checklist, Page 18]

---

## 7. Recommendation & CTA lines (2–3 minutes)

Finish with explicit ad‑ready lines:

- “Who would you recommend the Activation Intensive to, and why?”  
- “What would you say to someone who is exactly where you were before, but is on the fence?”  
- “Finish this sentence: ‘If you’re a [avatar] who [pain], and you’re at a [their old score]/10 on vision clarity, you should do this because…’”

If you run every good Graduate through this structure, you’ll have:

- Long‑form story clips (full interview)  
- Short “from X → Y in 72 hours” metric clips  
- A “parade of proof” reel where 10 different people all answer the same 1–2 hook questions. [$100M Playbook GOATed Ads, Page 18],[$100M Playbook Marketing Machine, Page 19]

That’s how you turn your data‑driven surveys into emotional, pain‑to‑relief ads that actually convert.
