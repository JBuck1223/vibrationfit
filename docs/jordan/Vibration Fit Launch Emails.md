**Assumption:**

* **Offer \= “72-Hour Activation Intensive” \+ 8 weeks of VibrationFit membership starting the day they buy.**  
* **Normal price \= $499, test group price \= $1 as a founding tester style free trial.** \[$100M Money Models, Page 151\]

**Here’s exactly what I’d send.**  
---

### **Email to friends & family**

Subject (pick one):

* “Founding test group: 72‑Hour Activation Intensive for $1”  
* “Want to test our 72‑Hour Activation Intensive for $1?”

Body:

Hey \[Name\],

Our VibrationFit platform is finally ready, and we’re opening our first 72‑Hour Activation Intensive to a tiny “friends & family” test group.

We’d love for you to be part of it.

Here’s the deal:

* You get our full 72‑Hour Activation Intensive  
* Plus 8 weeks of VibrationFit membership, starting the day you join  
* Regular price will be $499  
* You get it as a founding tester for $1

Why $1?

Because this round is about testing and improving, not making money. I want honest feedback, bug reports, and (if it genuinely helps you) a testimonial we can use when we launch publicly.

What the 72‑Hour Activation Intensive is about:

* Getting crystal clear on your vision for your life  
* Getting into vibrational harmony with that vision  
* Starting to turn that vision into real, tangible experiences

What I ask from you:

* Go through the 72‑hour experience sometime in the next \[X\] days  
* Tell us what you loved, what was confusing, and what you’d change  
* If it helps you, be open to sharing a short written or video testimonial

If you’re in, grab your spot for $1 here: https://vibrationfit.com/?promo=LAUNCH2026

We’re only taking about 15–20 people, and your 8 weeks of membership starts the day you sign up.

Thank you for helping us get this into the world,  
\[Your Name\]

### **Text message flow**

Initial text:

*Hey\! We just finished building our VibrationFit platform and I’m running a tiny “friends & family” test of our 72‑Hour Activation Intensive. It’ll be $499 when we launch, but I’m giving this first round for $1, and it also includes 8 weeks of membership starting when you join.All I’m asking for is honest feedback (and a testimonial if you love it). Want me to send you the link?*

If they say  yes:  
*Amazing, thank you\! Here’s the $1 founding tester link for the 72‑Hour Activation Intensive \+ 8 weeks of membership: https://vibrationfit.com/?promo=LAUNCH2026*

*We’re only taking about 15–20 people in this first round, so grab it when you can.*  
That’s it. One clear email, one clear text. Then your real work starts: make these 15–20 people win so hard that their stories do the selling for you later.

---

**Assumption:**  
**They paid $1 for the 72‑Hour Activation Intensive \+ 8 weeks. On Day 56 their plan renews into Vision Pro Annual at $999/year (or whatever plan you set at checkout).**

Here’s the email I’d use:

**Subject: Quick heads up about your VibrationFit membership**

Hey \[First Name\],

Quick heads up so there are no surprises.

When you joined the 72‑Hour Activation Intensive, you also unlocked 8 weeks of Vision Pro membership as part of that $1 founding tester offer.

On \[DATE\], your membership is set to renew into Vision Pro Annual at $999 for 12 months (billed once, then locked in for the year).

That renewal includes:

Full access to the Vision Builder and all creation tools  
Unlimited vision boards, audios, journaling, and progress tracking  
Your satisfaction guarantee window from the membership terms  
Priority access to new features and future activations  
If you’re loving the platform and want to stay on your journey with us, you don’t need to do anything. Your membership will renew automatically on \[DATE\], and your rate will be locked in for the year.

If you don’t want to continue, no hard feelings at all.  
You can cancel any time before \[DATE\] here:  
\[Manage / cancel link\]

I’d much rather be overly clear now than have you feel surprised later. If you have any questions about what’s included, or want help deciding whether to stay, just hit reply and I’ll walk you through it.

Thank you again for being part of the first group inside VibrationFit. You helped us bring this to life.

With much appreciation,  
\[Your Name\]

Optional short text 3–5 days before:

Hey \[Name\], quick reminder: your VibrationFit Vision Pro membership is set to renew on \[DATE\] at $999 for 12 months. If you’re loving it, you’re all set. If you’d rather cancel before it renews, you can do that here: \[link\]. Just want to make sure there are no surprises.

This does three things:

Re‑anchors the value of what they’re getting.  
Makes you look fair and transparent, which lowers chargeback risk.  
Gives them a clear, easy action whether they stay or leave.

Pill badge: ORIENTATION  
Headline: Here’s how this works

Hi {{firstName}},

You’re inside the 72‑Hour Activation Intensive. Here’s what that actually means and what to focus on first.

What you’re building  
The Intensive is a 14‑step guided path. By the end, you’ll have:

Your Life Vision written across 12 categories, built with VIVA  
A personalized Activation Audio (morning \+ evening)  
A Vision Board with images for each category  
Your first Conscious Creation Journal entry  
A live Calibration Call booked  
A 28‑Day Activation Plan to make it your daily rhythm  
That’s what “done” looks like. Not “I read about it.” You’ll have a living system drafted, recorded, visualized, and scheduled.

Your first 24 hours: 3 things  
Log in and set your password  
If you haven’t already, this takes 30 seconds.  
Log in →

Start your Intensive  
Click “Start My Activation Intensive” on your dashboard. This begins your 72‑hour focus window.

Complete Steps 1–4 (Account, Intake, Profile, Assessment)  
These are your foundation. Once your profile and Vibration Assessment are done, everything that follows – your Vision, your Audios, your Board – is built on what you share here.

Plan on one focused session (about 60–90 minutes) to knock these out.

Your $1 Founding Tester access  
You paid $1 today to verify your payment method. Here’s exactly what that means:

What you have right now:  
Full access to the 72‑Hour Activation Intensive \+ 8 weeks of Vision Pro. Same platform, same tools, same VIVA – nothing is held back.

What happens on Day 56:  
Your selected plan begins automatically:

Annual: $999/year (about $76.85 per 28‑day cycle)  
28‑Day: $99, renews every 28 days  
If you want to change or cancel:  
You can switch plans or cancel anytime before Day 56\. No charge beyond your $1. You can manage this from your Account Settings.

No surprises. No fine print.

**Day 3 Email – Activation \+ Completion**  
**Trigger:**

**Send X hours after they click “Start My Activation Intensive” and are on Day 3 (or simply at T+48 hours from start).**  
Subject: Today: Activate your vision & unlock your platform  
Pre-header: Finish your 72‑Hour Activation Intensive strong.

Hi {{firstName}},

You’re in the final stretch of your **72‑Hour Activation Intensive**.

By the end of today, you’ll have your vision **activated** and your full Vibration Fit platform **unlocked.**

**Today’s focus**  
Log into your dashboard and complete the last two phases:

1. **Activation (Steps 10–12)**  
* Vision Board  
* Journal Entry  
* Book Calibration Call  
2. **Completion (Steps 13–14)**  
* MAP (My Activation Plan)  
* **Unlock Platform**

\[Go to my next step →[https://vibrationfit.com/auth/login](https://vibrationfit.com/auth/login)\]

**What “Unlock Platform” actually does**

When you reach **Step 14 – Unlock Platform**, you’ll see:

* A **Journey Summary** with green checks across all 14 steps  
* An **Activation Snapshot** where you’ll quickly rate how things feel now vs when you started (the system shows your original baseline answers and what you’ve actually built: visions, audios, boards, etc.)  
* One final question: “**What feels most different for you?**”  
  * You can record a short video  
  * Or type your response instead  
* A simple choice on how we’re allowed to share your success (named, anonymous, or not at all)

When you click **Unlock Platform** at the bottom:

* Your Intensive is marked completed  
* Your main dashboard unlocks   
* You get the full Vibration Fit experience you’ve been working toward

This is your graduation moment.

**Why it matters**  
For you: it creates a clear **before/after snapshot** you can look back on when life changes start stacking.

For us: as a **$1 Founding Tester**, your answers and story are what help us improve the platform and help future members win. 

Give yourself one focused block today to complete through **Unlock Platform**. Don’t leave your story half‑written.

If anything on the final steps is confusing or broken, click the Support button while logged in (vibrationfit.com/support) and choose “**Bug Report**” so we can fix it fast.

You’ve come all this way. Finish the path and step into the platform you just built for your future self.

With you,

**4\. Intensive Debrief \+ Testimonial Ask (Day 4\) make it conditional**

The “Final step: unlock your platform & capture your results” email should:

Only send if:  
They clicked “Start My Activation Intensive”  
They’ve completed at least up through Step 13  
unlock\_completed \!= true  
It’s been \~12–24 hours since the Day 3 email (or \~60 hours since they started)  
In that context, the email isn’t redundant; it’s a win‑back for almost‑finishers.

**Subject: Final step: unlock your platform & capture your results**  
Pre‑header: 14 of 14: your before/after snapshot \+ sharing what shifted.

Hi {{firstName}},

I can see you’ve made it all the way through your **72‑Hour Activation Intensive**.

There’s one last step: **Unlock Platform**.

This is **Step 14 of 14**, and it does two things at once:

**1\. Captures your before/after**

You’ll answer a short set of questions so the system can compare your post‑intensive answers with your original Baseline Intake. You’ll literally see:

* How clear your vision feels now  
* How empowered you are to stay in vibrational harmony  
* How easy it is to create and update your vision, audios, and board  
* How clear your MAP feels

**2\. Graduates you & unlocks your full platform**

When you click **Unlock Platform** at the bottom:

Your Intensive is marked **completed**  
Your main dashboard unlocks  
You’ll see a celebration state and your full Vibration Fit experience opens up

\[Go to my Unlock Platform step → [https://vibrationfit.com/auth/login](https://vibrationfit.com/auth/login)\]

**What we’ll ask you**  
On the Unlock page you’ll see:

* A **Journey Summary** showing green checks across all 14 steps  
* An **Activation Snapshot** with 11 quick questions (most already pre‑scored based on what you’ve built)  
* One final question: “**What feels most different for you?**”  
  * You can record a short video (up to 3 minutes)  
  * Or type your response instead

This is your moment to describe, in your own words, what shifted – in clarity, confidence, or how you see and shape your life now. Specific stories and concrete changes are gold here. 

You’ll also choose how (or if) we can share your success:

* With first name  
* Anonymously  
* Or not at all

**Why this matters (especially as a $1 Founding Tester)**

Your Unlock step isn’t just for us.

* It gives **you** a clear “before vs after” snapshot you can look back on later.  
* It gives **us** the proof and insight we need to improve the platform and help more people. 

You paid $1 and did the work. Finish this last step so you leave with a complete story and a fully unlocked platform.

\[Complete Unlock Platform now → [https://vibrationfit.com/auth/login](https://vibrationfit.com/auth/login)\]

With deep appreciation for helping us build this,  
The Vibration Fit Team

*If anything on the Unlock page is confusing or broken, click the Support button or go to vibrationfit.com/support while you’re logged in and choose “Bug Report” so we can fix it fast.*

## **7\. Renewal Confirmation / Receipt**

Goal: Close the loop and reduce refund fights.

---

## **9\. Cancellation & Winback Emails**

a) Cancellation confirmation

* “You’re canceled effective X. Here’s what you’ll lose.”  
* One link to quick exit survey.

b) Winback (30–60 days later)
