# The Life I Choose Program
## A Step-by-Step Framework for Conscious Creation

---

## Welcome to "The Life I Choose" Program!

What if your life didn't happen by default… but by design?

What if, instead of reacting to life, you became the conscious creator of your most fun, fulfilling, and expansive reality?

That's exactly what The Life I Choose Program is here to help you do.

### This Program Will Help You:

💫 **Clarify your vision** – Define what you truly want in life. Clarity gives direction. Without a vision, we operate on autopilot. But when we define our desires, the Universe starts assembling the fastest, most exciting path forward.

💫 **Align with your desires** – We teach you how to train your vibration to attract the life YOU choose.

💫 **Track Your Progress** – Enjoy the journey to all of your manifestations as you track your expansion and progress along the way. We often achieve something and immediately shift to the next goal—forgetting how far we've come. Documenting progress keeps us in positive expectation and reminds us of the magic unfolding.

💫 **Amplify your manifestations** – Implement our multi-layer activation system to keep your vision alive 24/7 and accelerate results.

Your focus creates your future. When you hold a clear and compelling vision, the Universe mirrors it back to you. This document isn't just about planning—it's about shifting your vibrational state so you naturally begin living this reality.

If we're not intentional about building our life around fun, we have to build our fun around life (which is really no fun). This system ensures that you are always moving toward a life that excites and fulfills you—on purpose.

## Preface

There is Universal magic at play when we choose to consciously create. The Law of Attraction is always bringing together cooperative components of similar vibration—this applies to us in the physical as well as to us in the non-physical. New preferences are born as a result of every experience we have in the physical. Our non-physical self immediately lines up with these new preferences. Our physical self has the choice to align with or resist these new-born preferences. When both points of focus (physical and non-physical) align with the expansion that has already taken place, we have access to clarity on the blueprint for our most satisfying life experience. And when aligned with that vibrational blueprint, things manifest in better ways than we ever could have planned!

Conscious creation is an eternal game. And when we know how to successfully play, it's fun. The most fun part of life is experiencing ourselves as the conscious creator of our own life experience. That means being able to connect the dots to all of the people, circumstances and events in our life and know that we were the one responsible for attracting it all.

When we (Jordan & Vanessa) implemented The Life I Choose Program, we started experiencing ourselves as the creators of our reality in a way we never had before. Having done a version of this process for over a decade now, It is really fun to look back on all that has manifested that at one time was just an idea we placed on paper. Looking back at our own vision documents—scribbled across legal pads, notebooks, online drives, random Word docs, file cabinets and keepsake boxes—it's incredible to see how much we have intentionally manifested. We wish we had a structured program and tracking system like this when we first started. And now, you do.

This program gives you an incredible head start in creating your dream life—not just in your imagination, but in tangible, trackable ways. We find so much joy in looking back at these documents that previous versions of ourselves wrote down. It's truly empowering in reminding us of our incredible power as conscious creators. We hope you too thoroughly enjoy this process and the beautiful unfolding of the life YOU choose!

## PART 1: VIBRATIONAL ALIGNMENT

### Tuning In

Before capturing clarity, we must first align vibrationally so that our vision flows from an inspired place rather than from a place of frustration, confusion, or lack.

Everything we desire—whether it's more freedom, love, success, adventure, or well-being—is at some level because we believe we will feel better in the having of it. So why wait? Why not align with that feeling now?

Don't worry if you don't have 100% clarity on everything you want in every area of life right now. Simply shifting from "I don't know what I want" to "I want to know what I want" activates the Universe to begin orchestrating experiences that bring your desires into focus.

Most people know they have emotions, but few understand the precise guidance their emotions are delivering.

#### Here's the truth:

💡 **Clarity on what you want is always available.** It already exists in the vibrational realm of your consciousness.

💡 **Your non-physical self holds the blueprint.** This steady vibrational signature reflects the most emotionally satisfying version of your life, incorporating every preference you've ever formed.

💡 **Your emotions are your navigation system.** When you feel good, you're in harmony with your highest path. When you feel off, it's an indicator that your focus is out of alignment with all you've become.

The Law of Attraction is always working—whether we're aware of it or not. When we don't use our emotional guidance, we create by default, based on old vibrational habits. But when we consciously align with the vibrational signature of our best life, we begin attracting elements of our physical reality that stimulate wonderful emotional states.

And here's the kicker—**all aspects of your most satisfying life already work in harmony.** There is no contradiction between having:

✅ A thriving career AND deep, fulfilling relationships
✅ A wildly abundant life AND total freedom
✅ A strong, energized body AND endless fun

This is a both/AND Universe, not an either/or reality.

🔹 The Life I Choose acts as your GPS, helping you gain clarity and navigate your desires with precision. Just like plugging a destination into a navigation system, your Source continually recalculates the best path for you—no matter how many times you change your mind or take detours along the way.

And since you can have anything you choose, why not define the most fun, fulfilling, and expansive destinations and let Source be your infinite tour guide?

With "The Life I Choose" in place, the only limit to your experience is your willingness to dream.

---

### Vibrational Warmup

Before we jump into the fun part of starting to define your vision, we need to warm up your vision muscles.

If you're like most humans, your dream muscles may have atrophied. No worries—we're about to get them back in shape.

The purpose of this warmup is to align you with the infinite part of your consciousness before continuing into the action. It's unwise to start lifting weights before first warming up your muscles. In the same way, let's take care of our vibration muscles and get them in the receiving mode of the next exercise.

Vibrationally speaking, you only have access to thoughts that are a vibrational match to what's currently active in your mind. If you've been focused in contrast for a while, expecting yourself to instantly receive clarity on every aspect of your dream life is unrealistic.

That's why we're starting with this powerful incantation — a declaration to activate your conscious creator energy.

#### About the Incantation:

💡 Focuses on alignment before action.
💡 Reminds us of our incredible power as a deliberate creator.
💡 You may not believe it the first few times you say it, and that's ok.
💡 The key is to say it anyway—with intensity and emotion, to put ourselves in a state of believing and receiving.

💥 **Read the following incantation aloud as many times as you need until you feel it in your bones:**

---

### Incantation:

**"I am doing this! I'm taking the initiative to have a vibration transformation in my life!**

**The infinite part of my consciousness is always there, always excited, and elated when I acknowledge it and decide to be all that I've become. This is a process of discovery. I know the vibrational signature of my most satisfying life already exists. My intention now is to tap into it and allow myself an unabridged look into what I've already become.**

**As I align with all I've become and allow my physical and non-physical points of focus to collaborate, I unleash the power of the Universe and allow the most fun and satisfying version of me to be now. With this Universal leverage on my side, everything is possible.**

**This vision serves as my magnet, attracting the exact right people, ideas, resources, strategies, events, and circumstances that orchestrate its beautiful unfolding. I hereby give the Universe full permission to open all doors leading to the joyful experience of this or something even better. Thank you in advance for this fun and satisfying journey. I am truly grateful for the opportunity to be here and experience myself as the conscious creator of the The Life I Choose."**

## PART 2: HOW TO WRITE YOUR VISION FOR MAXIMUM MANIFESTATION

Your desires are already real in vibrational form. The purpose of "The Life I Choose" is to tune in, gain clarity, and allow that vision to become your physical reality. With that being said, the way you write your vision matters!

### Inserting the Magic:

### 1. Write in Present Tense

Write as if it's happening NOW.

#### Example: Health | Body Category

❌ "I want to be healthy and fit."

✅ "I feel so vibrant and alive in my body! Every breath fills me with energy, and movement feels effortless and exhilarating. I love the way my body flows with strength and ease—whether I'm stretching, running, or simply enjoying a deep, refreshing inhale. My skin glows with radiance, my digestion feels light and effortless, and I wake up every morning feeling refreshed and ready for the day. Nourishing my body with delicious, nutrient-rich foods is a joy, and every sip of water feels like liquid vitality replenishing my cells. I move through my day with confidence, knowing my body is thriving!"

#### Example: Money | Assets | Investments Category

❌ "I want more money."

✅ "I love the feeling of financial abundance flowing effortlessly into my life! Money comes to me in exciting and unexpected ways, and I feel completely supported in every financial decision I make. I enjoy the freedom of choosing experiences, investments, and adventures that light me up. Paying bills feels effortless, knowing that my income is always growing. I get a thrill seeing my bank account numbers rise and love watching my wealth expand in fun, fulfilling ways. Whether I'm treating myself to something luxurious, giving generously, or investing in my dreams, money is an easy, natural, and joyful part of my life!"

#### Example: Love | Romance | Spouse | Partner Category

❌ "I want a great relationship."

✅ "Let's make this real! How does love feel for you? What are the little moments that make it special? Try this: 'I love waking up beside my partner, feeling the warmth of their embrace and the gentle rhythm of their breath. Our laughter fills the air as we make breakfast together, savoring the sweet aroma of coffee and cinnamon. Every moment feels light, playful, and deeply connected. I feel cherished, seen, and wildly adored in the most natural, effortless way."

#### Example: Business | Career | Work Category

❌ "I want a successful business."

✅ "I wake up every morning feeling energized and deeply fulfilled knowing I'm making an impact with my thriving business. The excitement of creating innovative offerings fuels me, and I love the freedom my business gives me to travel, explore, and collaborate with incredible, high-vibe people. Seeing testimonials from happy clients brings an overwhelming sense of gratitude and satisfaction."

#### Example: Variety | Travel | Adventure Category

❌ "I want to go to the beach in Thailand someday."

✅ "I love the feeling of the warm Thailand sun on my skin, enveloping me in a soft, golden glow. The sound of the waves gently lapping against the shore soothes my soul. Every step on the silky sand feels like a luxurious massage beneath my feet. I laugh with my travel companions as we sip on fresh coconut water, feeling completely relaxed and free. The vibrant colors of the local markets and the joyful energy of the people make this experience absolutely magical!"

Write in the present tense, as if you are already experiencing it.

🌟 **Why?** Because the Law of Attraction responds to your present moment vibrational offering! Your subconscious doesn't know the difference between what are real circumstances versus imaginative ones. When you write in the present tense, your vibrational offering becomes it, and you begin attracting it.

The target is to collapse time frames on a vibrational level. The closer we get to feeling it as present now, the more in harmony we are with the active vibration within. That being said, these statements made as affirmations are not effective without a basis in truth. We will help you craft your vision in a way that you can state it out loud to yourself while looking in the mirror, and truly believe every word that you're saying. We do this by starting with the clarity you have access to right now and filling in the details as they come into scope.

---

### 2. Find The Feeling Place

Infuse it with emotion by using sensory details. In the examples above you can see how rich the descriptions are for what you see, hear, smell, taste, and feel while "having" the experience. How does it truly feel to be experiencing this? Use our Good-Feeling Sensory Words document for feeling-word ideas!

For example, turn this:

🚫 "My dream home feels nice."
🚫 "Travel feels fun."

Into this:

✅ "Sunlight pours into my large, sweeping bedroom windows and the smell of beautiful gardenias and jasmine dance through the air from the beautifully manicured garden in my backyard. My mornings feel peaceful, easeful, and exciting."

✅ "I explore new places often, and each trip brings me fresh inspiration and deep joy as I experience people, food, smells, and views I've never experienced before. I love connecting with super fun people from around the globe."

The better you get at this, the more you'll be in harmony with The Life You Choose, and more importantly, experiencing positive emotion as a result of being in alignment with your infinite self.

---

### 3. Take Pressure Off Your First Iteration

This is your first iteration of "The Life I Choose." We promise it won't be the last! Don't worry about making it perfect. You can always refine it later. This is about feeling the essence of your dream life, not getting every detail "right".

Go into as much detail as feels good in the moment and if you get stuck, move on to another category and come back later. Clarity builds with momentum.

---

### 4. Make Space

Make space for this program. This is not an exercise that you want to breeze through. This deserves your full attention and imagination when you're working on it for this to be effective in your life, and can even be fun if you allow it to be.

Sometimes we may think, "I don't have time for this," but the truth is we don't have time to not have a compelling vision for our life. When we hold a steadfast vision for what it is we want in life, the Universe assembles beacons of light that illuminate and call us toward the path of least resistance toward them. We don't waste nearly as much time wandering since we have an idea of where we're going and guidance towards it. Using "The Life I Choose" Program, you will be shocked by how rapidly the infinite energy of the universe wraps itself around your vision and begins propelling you into this new reality.

This process will become easier each time you do it, and remember, you always have the warmup exercise to revisit to assist you in attuning to your vision.

---

## PART 3: CAPTURING YOUR CLARITY

### Preface

Now it's time to start defining your desires. Let's start honing in on who the infinite part of your consciousness has become and have fun gaining clarity around and allowing that awesome-feeling version of you to be NOW.

These prompts are designed to help you define an inspiring life vision. The purpose of this exercise is to gain clarity on more of what you want. Every experience you've ever had is extremely valuable in achieving this. (If you feel really stuck in the contrast you're experiencing right now, complete this process first before moving forward: Clarity From Contrast.)

**So Universe... What does the most fun and satisfying version of my life look like?...**

## PART 4: MULTI-LAYERED ACTIVATION

CONGRATULATIONS!!! If you've made it to this point, you have the first iteration of your vision document. Now it's time to take it to the next level! Writing your vision is only the first step. To make it a living, breathing reality, you must continue to activate the vibration of "The Life You Choose" which is exactly what we're going to walk you through in this part.

This multi-layered activation system reinforces your vision 24/7—through conscious, subconscious, and real-time activation, eventually making the essence of "The Life I Choose" your new default vibrational offering.

---

## 3 Layers of Activation:

### Conscious Activation

**How?**  
Reading back your vision document regularly.

**Why it works?**  
Reminds you of the clarity you have already captured and makes it a familiar place to visit vibrationally.

---

### Subconscious Activation

**How?**  
Recording your vision document in your own voice and listening to it under an immersion audio track while you sleep.

**Why it works?**  
Listening to your vision document while you sleep helps embed your vision into your subconscious mind—so it starts working for you automatically. There's no resistance while you sleep, meaning it's the perfect time to allow your subconscious to be programmed with all of the things you choose to attract!

---

### Real-Time Activation

**How?**  
Listening to category-specific parts of your vision document when relevant.

For example:

🎧 On the way to work? → Listen to Business | Career | Work section.
🏋 Going to the gym? → Listen to Health | Body section.
🏡 On the way to pick up kids from school? → Listen to Parenting | Family section.
💖 Getting ready for date night? → Listen to Love | Romance | Spouse section.
💰 About to pay some bills? → Listen to Money | Assets | Investments section.

**Why it works?**  
Category-specific listening allows you to do some vibrational pre-paving before stepping into real-life experiences! This sets the stage for more intentional, fun experiences to be had just by getting into alignment around the subject before engaging with it.

---

## PART 5: ITERATE

### This Is An Iterative Process

Knowing that you are an eternal being, remember that this is an iterative process. This may be the first iteration, but we promise it will not be the last! Our intention with "The Life I Choose" is to help you thoroughly enjoy the expansion of your desires, the journey toward the manifestation of them, and the manifestations themselves! Each new place that you step into becomes the launchpad for the next best iteration of yourself. With this in mind, you realize you never "get it done" and in fact, would never want to because it's all so much fun!

Your vision is a **living document**—it grows as you do.

### Next steps to iterate:

✅ **Continue to activate vision**—activate the vibration of "The Life I Choose" with the multi-layered activation plan. The more you **activate it**, the stronger its vibrational pull.

✅ **Adjust as clarity expands**—as you evolve, so does your vision. As you activate your vision and continue to gain clarity on what that looks like, capture your new clarity by adding to and revising your vision document. **Add sensory details.** As you evolve, refine each section to **feel even more real** to you.

✅ **Celebrate progress**—track manifestations and your expansion along the way by remembering to upload all iterations of your "Life I Choose" document to your profile at VibrationFit.com.

This is conscious creation! Have fun and if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please share with us. Together we're fine-tuning the process of conscious creation!

---

### Using "The Life I Choose" As A Life Filter

Life comes at you fast. How do we make decisions on the fly knowing they are taking us in the direction of the life we've intentionally designed for ourselves? That's where this vision document comes in.

When decisions must be made on any given subject, you now have a life filter to run the decision through. You will be amazed at how clear things become when you have this filter. Decisions that may have before been difficult to choose a path on all of a sudden become clear as night and day. This can happen with small seemingly inconsequential choices made day in and day out, and large decisions that get made around career paths, romantic relationships, finances, and other highly impactful areas of life.

In this stage of the game, it is extremely important to be operating above the green line in harmony with your life vision. It will take courage to make decision after decision with clear guidance from your new life filter, but the more you flex the muscle of empowered choice, the stronger it will become. Ultimately, you will be unshakable in the firm decisions you make about your life moving forward. When the people around you freak out (and they will) remember this is the Life You Choose for You, not the Life you're choosing in attempt to make everyone around you happy.
