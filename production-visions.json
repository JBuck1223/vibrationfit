We love being able to relate to all sorts of people as a result of being well-traveled.\n\nWe enjoy traveling often to new and exciting destinations. It’s so much fun having infinite resources to pay for any and all types of travel and entertainment.

We have a streamlined system for documenting and turning our photos and videos into purposeful content for our business and family. Our team of people make this process simple and fun! Many people are inspired and motivated by the incredible life we live.\n\nWe love the variety of our travels. We love going to tropical destinations like Costa Rica, Fiji, Bali, Thailand, Bora Bora, mountainous destinations like New Zealand, Austria, France, and other fun places across Europe, Africa, Australia, North America, South America, and Asia. We love going on epic adventures like hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, experiencing the mystery of Stonehenge, seeing the grandness of the Taj Mahal in India, feeling the splendor of the mountains from the Sound of Music, and visiting cool villages with unique trinkets around the Mediterranean Sea. We are completely open to new experiences and enjoy hearing about and doing things that are interesting to us.\n\nIn America, we’re excited for our continuing experiences at State and National Parks and other scenic places. We love camping/glamping and seeing cool areas that are new and interesting to us.\n\nIn the following examples, we will give a brief description of specific trips we choose to experience. We will go on many trips with similar signatures, but these will be absolutes that we choose to experience and set the framework for many excursions we choose to go on as we live the life we choose.\n\nOne of the adventures that we’re most excited about taking is an Alaskan cruise. We can feel the vastness of the glaciers, mountains, and coastal scenery. It is breathtaking to see the Northern Lights illuminating the sky in colors we’ve never seen among the stars before. We are thrilled to see ginormous, beautiful whales in the water surrounding the massive cruise ship. Time slows down as we take in the splendor of Glacier Bay National Park from aboard the ship. At one of the stops, we go dog-sledding across the snow and experience first hand what life is like for people who live in these frigid areas of the world.\n\nAnother adventure we are very excited about going on is gallivanting across European countries. Some of the things we enjoy experiencing include the mystery of Stonehenge, the grandness of The Swiss Alps and the Austrian mountains from the Sound of Music, the lights of The Eiffel Tower, the vastness of the Cliffs of Moher, the magic of the spirit of Ireland, the landscape of Scotland, the adorable countryside towns, and the beauty of the beaches of Normandy.

We know and meet lots of awesome people who live throughout Europe and help us have exciting, memorable times.\n\nWe get around the most fun, safe, and easy ways. Everything always works out for us perfectly as we navigate new territories. We drive fun cars, fly in comfortable planes, have incredible experiences on scenic trains, ride cool electric vehicles, and experience other satisfying ways of getting around with great, capable people.\n\nWhen we travel, we have the ability to fly first class on commercial planes or fly by private plane. We have access to multiple different types of private air travel and are free to be transported to many destinations whenever we choose to go! It is extremely fun to take people in our sphere of influence and friends and family on incredible trips all over the nation and the world in first class or by private air. When we fly privately, it feels so easy, fun and significant to show up at the airport and simply go directly to the air strip with whatever we choose to take with us. We get on the plane and enjoy conversation, snacks, and drinks if we choose to on the flight. Our private plane takes us wherever we choose to go. When we land, we are greeted by attendants and have private vehicle transportation to take us to our destination. It is incredibly fun to travel in this way!\n\nWe love meeting people from different cultures while traveling and hearing their unique accents and experience living there.

We share this information with our Vibe Tribe and the world to elevate the vibration of the planet.\n\nWe love learning different culture’s ways of life and their history. It’s so much fun connecting the dots of humanity, deepening our understanding of what makes humans tick and further fine-tuning the process of conscious creation.

We love going on epic adventures like hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, experiencing the mystery of Stonehenge, seeing the grandness of the Taj Mahal in India, feeling the splendor of the mountains from the Sound of Music, and visiting cool villages with unique trinkets around the Mediterranean Sea. We are completely open to new experiences and enjoy hearing about and doing things that are interesting to us.\n\nIn America, we’re excited for our continuing experiences at State and National Parks and other scenic places. We love camping/glamping and seeing cool areas that are new and interesting to us.\n\nIn the following examples, we will give a brief description of specific trips we choose to experience. We will go on many trips with similar signatures, but these will be absolutes that we choose to experience and set the framework for many excursions we choose to go on as we live the life we choose.\n\nOne of the adventures that we’re most excited about taking is an Alaskan cruise. We can feel the vastness of the glaciers, mountains, and coastal scenery. It is breathtaking to see the Northern Lights illuminating the sky in colors we’ve never seen among the stars before. We are thrilled to see ginormous, beautiful whales in the water surrounding the massive cruise ship. Time slows down as we take in the splendor of Glacier Bay National Park from aboard the ship. At one of the stops, we go dog-sledding across the snow and experience first hand what life is like for people who live in these frigid areas of the world.\n\nAnother adventure we are very excited about going on is gallivanting across European countries. Some of the things we enjoy experiencing include the mystery of Stonehenge, the grandness of The Swiss Alps and the Austrian mountains from the Sound of Music, the lights of The Eiffel Tower, the vastness of the Cliffs of Moher, the magic of the spirit of Ireland, the landscape of Scotland, the adorable countryside towns, and the beauty of the beaches of Normandy. As we travel, we have the financial ability to experience each culture we encounter the way we choose! We enjoy the local cuisine, the different intriguing sites, and the local nightlife in all of our travels. We know and meet lots of awesome people who live throughout Europe and help us have exciting, memorable times.\n\nWe get around the most fun, safe, and easy ways. Everything always works out for us perfectly as we navigate new territories. We drive fun cars, fly in comfortable planes, have incredible experiences on scenic trains, ride cool electric vehicles, and experience other satisfying ways of getting around with great, capable people.\n\nWhen we travel, we have the ability to fly first class on commercial planes or fly by private plane. We have access to multiple different types of private air travel and are free to be transported to many destinations whenever we choose to go! It is extremely fun to take people in our sphere of influence and friends and family on incredible trips all over the nation and the world in first class or by private air. When we fly privately, it feels so easy, fun and significant to show up at the airport and simply go directly to the air strip with whatever we choose to take with us. We get on the plane and enjoy conversation, snacks, and drinks if we choose to on the flight. Our private plane takes us wherever we choose to go. When we land, we are greeted by attendants and have private vehicle transportation to take us to our destination. It is incredibly fun to travel in this way!\n\nWe love meeting people from different cultures while traveling and hearing their unique accents and experience living there. It’s so much fun being shown around by locals, always receiving the best information on where to eat and stay and where to go to have the absolute best experience everywhere we go!\n\nWe also love the extremely unique, safe, fun experiences we have with animals around the world.\n\nWe love traveling to areas as unique things are happening, like season changes, flower blooms, and snowfalls. We also love going to world renowned events and festivals that take place all over the world including Ocktoberfest in Germany, hot air balloon festivals, the Christmas markets throughout Europe, spectacular flower blooms, and music festivals.\n\nWe enjoy participating in invigorating activities around the world including zip lining, bungee jumping, scuba diving, swimming with dolphins, dogsledding, white water rafting, skiing, sledding, bathing in natural hot-springs, camping, rock climbing, hiking, sky diving and cycling. We also love unique stays in places like overwater bungalows in Bora Bora, underwater hotels,  desolate domes, and treehouses.\n\nWhile traveling, we seek the world’s best information and practices for living an elevated emotional quality of life. We share this information with our Vibe Tribe and the world to elevate the vibration of the planet.\n\nWe love learning different culture’s ways of life and their history. It’s so much fun connecting the dots of humanity, deepening our understanding of what makes humans tick and further fine-tuning the process of conscious creation. We love sharing fresh information and systems in powerful ways that resonate with people.",
    "home": "We have multiple residences.\n\nOur tropical residence in Sarasota, FL is close to many pristine, white sandy beaches with crystal clear water and easily accessible to the highway and lots of commerce.\n\nOur seasonal residence is a magical cottage where we stay to watch the seasons change. In autumn, we come here to watch the leaves change into marvelous colors, and in winter, we come to experience the cold, crisp air and watch the snowfall.

Our flower gardens contain a beautiful array of roses, jasmine, gardenias, and other beautiful and aromatic plants and flowers.\n\nWe love eating in our covered outdoor dining area, entertaining, playing cards and boardgames, cooking delicious meals, relaxing and playing in the hot tub, playing volleyball, kickball, croquet, bocce ball, and other sports in the yard, watching our outdoor television, relaxing on our porch in our comfortable chairs, staring in awe at the beautiful sky, watching and listening to the rain fall, and being entertained by the beautiful nature that surrounds us.\n\nWe have beautiful furnishings that are extremely comfortable.

We encourage them to follow their own bliss in life by always following our own.\n\nWe love spending quality time together while dancing, playing games, cuddling, watching movies, playing in the the backyard, jumping on the trampoline, swinging, having picnics, playing at parks, traveling, exploring, and much more.\n\nWe are confident and satiated in our role as parents.
