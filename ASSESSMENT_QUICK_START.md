# Assessment System - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What's Been Built

The complete VibrationFit Vibrational Assessment system is now ready! This includes:

### ✅ Database (PostgreSQL + Supabase)
- 3 tables: `assessment_results`, `assessment_responses`, `assessment_insights`
- Auto-scoring triggers
- Row-level security
- 84 questions across 12 life categories

### ✅ Backend (Next.js API Routes)
- `/api/assessment` - CRUD operations
- `/api/assessment/responses` - Response management
- `/api/assessment/progress` - Real-time progress tracking
- Client service layer for easy integration

### ✅ Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Full assessment flow at `/assessment`
- Question cards with Green Line indicators
- Progress tracker sidebar
- Results summary page
- Dashboard integration

### ✅ Scoring System
- Automatic calculation via database triggers
- Green Line status: Above (80%+), Transition (60-79%), Below (<60%)
- Per-category and overall scores

## 🚀 To Use the Assessment

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
```bash
# Make sure Docker Desktop is running
npx supabase start

# Apply the migration
npx supabase db reset
# OR
npx supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Start the Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Navigate to Assessment
Open your browser to:
- Direct: `http://localhost:3000/assessment`
- Dashboard: Click "Take Assessment" button

### Step 4: Complete Assessment
- Answer 7 questions per category (84 total)
- Progress saves automatically
- Results show at the end

## 📁 Key Files Created

### Database
- `supabase/migrations/20250111000000_create_assessment_tables.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/README_ASSESSMENT.md`

### Types
- `src/types/assessment.ts` (already existed, now fully utilized)

### Questions
- `src/lib/assessment/questions.ts` (your 84 questions + helper functions)

### API Routes
- `src/app/api/assessment/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/assessment/responses/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/assessment/progress/route.ts`

### Services
- `src/lib/services/assessmentService.ts`

### Components
- `src/app/assessment/page.tsx`
- `src/app/assessment/components/QuestionCard.tsx`
- `src/app/assessment/components/ProgressTracker.tsx`
- `src/app/assessment/components/ResultsSummary.tsx`

### Updated Files
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (added assessment CTA)

### Documentation
- `ASSESSMENT_SYSTEM.md` (comprehensive guide)
- `ASSESSMENT_QUICK_START.md` (this file)

## 🎨 Design Integration

All components use your VibrationFit design system:
- Green `#199D67` for "Above Green Line"
- Yellow `#FFB701` for "Transition"
- Red `#D03739` for "Below Green Line"
- Pill-shaped buttons
- Smooth animations
- Mobile-responsive

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **User starts assessment** → Creates new record in `assessment_results`
2. **Answers question** → Saves to `assessment_responses`
3. **Database trigger fires** → Auto-calculates scores
4. **Progress updates** → Real-time via API
5. **Completes assessment** → Shows results summary
6. **Generates vision** → (Next phase: VIVA integration)

## 📊 Scoring Explained

### Per Question
- 5 options: 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 points
- Green Line classification: above, neutral, below

### Per Category
- 7 questions × 10 max = 70 points max
- Percentage determines Green Line status

### Overall
- 12 categories × 70 = 840 points total
- Shows strongest areas and growth opportunities

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Database migration applied successfully
- [ ] Can navigate to `/assessment`
- [ ] Can answer questions
- [ ] Progress updates in sidebar
- [ ] Can navigate back/forward

## 🔮 Next Steps

### Phase 1: Testing & Polish
1. Test the full flow end-to-end
2. Adjust question wording if needed
3. Fine-tune UI animations

### Phase 2: VIVA Integration
1. Generate insights from assessment data
2. Use results for Life Vision generation
3. Create personalized recommendations

### Phase 3: Analytics
1. Track assessment completion rates
2. Historical tracking (retake over time)
3. Progress comparison reports

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Database Error
```
Error: relation "assessment_results" does not exist
```
**Fix:** Run `npx supabase db reset`

### Docker Error
```
Cannot connect to Docker daemon
```
**Fix:** Start Docker Desktop

### Build Error
```
Module not found: assessment.ts
```
**Fix:** The types were already in your project, should work fine

### API 401 Error
```
Unauthorized
```
**Fix:** Make sure you're logged in (visit `/auth/login`)
