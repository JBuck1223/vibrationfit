# Upload Success! ✅

Your 12.89MB video "Oliver test 1.mp4" uploaded successfully!

## Current Status

- ✅ File uploaded to S3
- ✅ Shows in journal
- ⏸️ No MediaConvert processing (12.9MB < 20MB threshold)

## What This Means

Your video is stored in S3 but hasn't been processed/compressed. This is expected behavior:
- Files < 20MB: Stored as-is (no MediaConvert job)
- Files > 20MB: MediaConvert processes them

## Options

### Option 1: Keep As-Is
- Your video is playing in the browser
- No action needed if it works

### Option 2: Process It Anyway
If you want MediaConvert to process this video anyway, I can:
- Find the file in S3
- Trigger a manual MediaConvert job
- Generate optimized versions (720p, 480p)

### Option 3: Test With Larger File
Upload a video > 20MB to test the MediaConvert pipeline

## What Would You Like To Do?

1. Leave it as-is (works fine)
2. Process it manually with MediaConvert
3. Test with a larger file (>20MB)

Let me know!
