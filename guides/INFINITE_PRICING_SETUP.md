## 📊 Revenue Projections

### Monthly Revenue per User
- Monthly: $97
- Yearly: $65/mo average

### If 70% choose yearly (typical with only 2 options):
- 30% monthly = $97
- 70% yearly = $65
- **Average: $75/mo per customer**

### Example Milestones
- 100 customers = $7,500/mo = $90,000/yr
- 500 customers = $37,500/mo = $450,000/yr
- 1,000 customers = $75,000/mo = $900,000/yr
