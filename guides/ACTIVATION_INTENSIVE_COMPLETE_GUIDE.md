### **Why This Model Works** (From $100M Playbook)

1. **Front-load value in one-time implementation** (education + execution), then keep monthly priced to ongoing consumption. This maximizes cash up front and stacks a durable base. *[$100M Playbook Retention, Page 26]*

2. **Include the recurring fee with the upfront purchase** on the same checkout to preserve the price anchor and improve stick‚Äîdon't make it a second sale. *[$100M Playbook Retention, Page 27]*

3. **Position as Short-Term Accelerator:** a one-time program that customers get when they become a member‚Äîperfect for generating cash to advertise and start continuity. *[$100M Money Models, Page 129]*

4. **Drive to activation fast.** Customers who hit the activation milestone early churn less; push for a first win inside the first days and recoup in 30 days. *[$100M Playbook Retention, Page 19]*

### **What the Business Gets:**
- **Qualified buyers** - $499 filters out tire-kickers
- **Immediate cash flow** - Funds customer acquisition costs (CAC)
- **Higher ROAS** - Collect meaningful cash up front while stacking continuity
- **"Get paid to get customers"** model *[$100M Playbook Retention, Page 27]*

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Database Schema:**

#### **Intensive Purchase Tracking:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE intensive_purchases (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  stripe_payment_intent_id TEXT,
  amount INTEGER NOT NULL, -- 49900 (cents)
  payment_plan TEXT, -- 'full', '2pay', '3pay'
  completion_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
  activation_deadline TIMESTAMP, -- 72 hours from purchase
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  completed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### **Intensive Checklist Tracking:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE intensive_checklist (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  intensive_id UUID REFERENCES intensive_purchases(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  
  -- Foundation Phase
  profile_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  assessment_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  calibration_scheduled BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  
  -- Vision Creation Phase
  vision_built BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  vision_refined BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  
  -- Activation Tools Phase
  audio_generated BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  vision_board_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  first_journal_entry BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  
  -- Calibration & Launch Phase
  calibration_call_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  activation_protocol_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  
  -- Timestamps for each completion
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **Intensive Mode Integration:**
All existing VibrationFit pages support `?intensive=true` query parameter:

```typescript
// Example: Profile completion tracking
const searchParams = useSearchParams()
const isIntensiveMode = searchParams.get('intensive') === 'true'

if (isIntensiveMode) {
  // Show intensive-specific UI
  // Track completion when profile reaches 70%+
  await markIntensiveStep('profile_completed')
  // Redirect to intensive dashboard
}
```

### **Helper Utility Functions:**
```typescript
// /src/lib/intensive/checklist.ts
export async function markIntensiveStep(step: string) {
  // Marks any intensive step as complete
  // Updates database and triggers progress recalculation
}

export async function getActiveIntensiveId(userId: string) {
  // Gets user's active intensive ID
  // Returns null if no active intensive
}
```
