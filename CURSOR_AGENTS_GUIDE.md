## How to Use Background Agents

### 1. Starting a Background Agent
1. Open the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`)
2. Type "Background Agent" and select "Start Background Agent"
3. Choose the agent role you want to work with
4. The agent will start analyzing your codebase

### 2. Working with Agents
- **Ask Questions**: Agents can answer questions about your codebase
- **Code Review**: Agents can review code and suggest improvements
- **Implementation**: Agents can help implement features
- **Debugging**: Agents can help debug issues
- **Documentation**: Agents can help with documentation

### 3. Agent Communication

- Be specific about what you want to accomplish
- Provide context about the current task
- Ask for explanations of complex code

## Best Practices for VibrationFit

### 1. Agent Selection
- **Frontend tasks**: Use Frontend Specialist
- **API/Database tasks**: Use Backend Specialist  
- **Component updates**: Use Design System Expert
- **Assessment features**: Use Assessment Specialist
- **Mobile issues**: Use Mobile Optimization Expert

### 2. Context Provision
- Always mention you're working on VibrationFit
- Reference specific files when asking questions
- Mention design system compliance requirements
- Specify mobile responsiveness needs

### 3. Task Examples

#### Frontend Development
```
"Help me create a new profile section component that follows the VibrationFit design system and is mobile-responsive"
```

#### Backend Development
```
"Create an API endpoint for saving assessment responses that integrates with our Supabase database"
```

#### Design System Updates
```
"Add a new button variant to the design system that follows our brand guidelines"
```

#### Assessment Features
```
"Implement the scoring algorithm for the assessment flow using our existing data models"
```

#### Mobile Optimization
```
"Fix the mobile layout for the profile edit page to ensure it works well on all screen sizes"
```

## Agent Workflows

### Feature Development Workflow
1. **Start with Frontend Agent** - Define UI requirements
2. **Move to Backend Agent** - Implement data models and APIs
3. **Use Design System Agent** - Ensure component consistency
4. **Finish with Mobile Agent** - Optimize for mobile

### Bug Fixing Workflow
1. **Identify the issue** with the appropriate specialist
2. **Get root cause analysis** from the relevant agent
3. **Implement the fix** with agent guidance
4. **Test and validate** with mobile agent if UI-related

### Code Review Workflow
1. **Ask for code review** from the relevant specialist
2. **Get suggestions** for improvements
3. **Implement changes** based on recommendations
4. **Verify compliance** with design system agent

## Tips for Effective Agent Use

### 1. Be Specific
- Don't just say "fix this" - explain what's wrong
- Provide specific requirements and constraints
- Mention any design system compliance needs

### 2. Provide Context
- Share relevant code snippets
- Include error messages
- Mention browser/device specifics
- Reference related files

### 3. Iterate
- Start with one agent, then refine with others
- Use agents to review and improve existing code
- Leverage agents for testing and validation

### 4. Document Changes
- Ask agents to document their changes
- Request code comments for complex logic
- Get explanations for design decisions

## Common Use Cases

### Adding New Features
1. **Frontend Agent**: "Create a new feature component"
2. **Backend Agent**: "Implement the API endpoints"
3. **Design System Agent**: "Ensure design system compliance"
4. **Mobile Agent**: "Optimize for mobile devices"

### Fixing Bugs
1. **Identify the bug** with the relevant specialist
2. **Get root cause analysis**
3. **Implement the fix**
4. **Test with mobile agent** if UI-related

### Performance Optimization
1. **Backend Agent**: "Optimize database queries"
2. **Frontend Agent**: "Improve component performance"
3. **Mobile Agent**: "Optimize mobile performance"

## Getting Started

1. **Enable Background Agents** in Cursor settings
2. **Configure agent roles** based on your needs
3. **Start with one agent** for a specific task
4. **Provide clear context** about what you're working on
5. **Iterate and refine** with additional agents as needed

## Example Session

**You**: "I need to add a new section to the profile edit page"

**Frontend Agent**: "I'll help you add a new profile section. Let me examine the current structure and create a new section component using the VibrationFit design system."

**You**: "The section should handle user preferences and use the existing form patterns"

**Frontend Agent**: "Perfect! I'll create a UserPreferencesSection component that follows the existing pattern and integrates with the design system."
