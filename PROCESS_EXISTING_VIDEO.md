# How to Process an Existing Video

## Option 1: Manual Processing via API
I can create an API call to process your existing video file in S3.

## Option 2: Test With Larger File
Upload a video > 20MB to trigger MediaConvert automatically.

## Option 3: Lower the Threshold
Change the MediaConvert threshold from 20MB to something lower (e.g., 10MB) so more videos get processed.

## What Would You Like?

1. Process the existing video manually
2. Upload a larger video (>20MB) to test  
3. Lower the threshold so videos get processed more often

Let me know your preference!
