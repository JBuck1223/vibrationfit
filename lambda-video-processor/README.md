# Lambda Video Processor - Auto-Trigger MediaConvert

This Lambda function automatically triggers MediaConvert jobs when videos are uploaded to S3.

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### 1. Create Lambda Function
```bash
cd lambda-video-processor
npm install
zip -r function.zip index.js node_modules package.json
```

### 2. Upload to AWS Lambda
1. Go to AWS Lambda Console
2. Click "Create function"
3. Choose "Author from scratch"
4. Function name: `video-processor-trigger`
5. Runtime: Node.js 20.x
6. Upload `function.zip`
7. Set these environment variables:
   - `AWS_REGION`: us-east-2
   - `BUCKET_NAME`: vibration-fit-client-storage
   - `MEDIACONVERT_ROLE_ARN`: (your MediaConvert role ARN)
   - `MEDIACONVERT_ENDPOINT`: (your MediaConvert endpoint)
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: (from Vercel env)
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: (from Vercel env)

### 3. Add S3 Event Trigger
1. Go to S3 Console
2. Select `vibration-fit-client-storage` bucket
3. Go to "Properties" â†’ "Event notifications"
4. Click "Create event notification"
5. Configure:
   - Event name: `trigger-video-processing`
   - Prefix: `user-uploads/`
   - Suffix: (leave empty or add video extensions)
   - Event types: `PUT` (ObjectCreated)
6. Destination: Lambda function â†’ `video-processor-trigger`

### 4. Set Permissions
Lambda needs permission to:
- Read from S3 (already has this from event)
- Call MediaConvert CreateJob

Add IAM policy to Lambda execution role:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "mediaconvert:CreateJob",
        "mediaconvert:GetJob",
        "mediaconvert:ListJobs"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## âœ… What Happens

1. User uploads video via presigned URL â†’ File lands in S3
2. S3 triggers Lambda function
3. Lambda creates MediaConvert job
4. MediaConvert processes video to 720p
5. Output goes to `/processed/` folder
6. User sees processing overlay, then processed video appears

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Upload a video and watch Lambda logs in CloudWatch to verify it's working!
