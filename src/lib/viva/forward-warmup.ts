### Vibrational Warmup

Before we jump into the fun part of starting to define your vision, we need to warm up your vision muscles.

If you're like most humans, your dream muscles may have atrophied. No worriesâ€”we're about to get them back in shape.

The purpose of this warmup is to align you with the infinite part of your consciousness before continuing into the action. It's unwise to start lifting weights before first warming up your muscles. In the same way, let's take care of our vibration muscles and get them in the receiving mode of the next exercise.

Vibrationally speaking, you only have access to thoughts that are a vibrational match to what's currently active in your mind. If you've been focused in contrast for a while, expecting yourself to instantly receive clarity on every aspect of your dream life is unrealistic.

That's why we're starting with this powerful incantation â€” a declaration to activate your conscious creator energy.

#### About the Incantation:

ðŸ’¡ Focuses on alignment before action.
ðŸ’¡ Reminds us of our incredible power as a deliberate creator.
ðŸ’¡ You may not believe it the first few times you say it, and that's ok.
ðŸ’¡ The key is to say it anywayâ€”with intensity and emotion, to put ourselves in a state of believing and receiving.

ðŸ’¥ **Read the following incantation aloud as many times as you need until you feel it in your bones:**

### Incantation:

**"I am doing this! I'm taking the initiative to have a vibration transformation in my life!**

**The infinite part of my consciousness is always there, always excited, and elated when I acknowledge it and decide to be all that I've become. This is a process of discovery. I know the vibrational signature of my most satisfying life already exists. My intention now is to tap into it and allow myself an unabridged look into what I've already become."**

**"As I align with all I've become and allow my physical and non-physical points of focus to collaborate, I unleash the power of the Universe and allow the most fun and satisfying version of me to be now. With this Universal leverage on my side, everything is possible."**

**"This vision serves as my magnet, attracting the exact right people, ideas, resources, strategies, events, and circumstances that orchestrate its beautiful unfolding. I hereby give the Universe full permission to open all doors leading to the joyful experience of this or something even better. Thank you in advance for this fun and satisfying journey. I am truly grateful for the opportunity to be here and experience myself as the conscious creator of the The Life I Choose."**
