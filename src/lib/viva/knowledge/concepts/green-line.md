**Last Updated:** January 31, 2025
**Version:** 2.0
**Status:** Core Philosophy

## Definition

The "Green Line" is a threshold concept that represents **vibrational alignment** - living in an empowered, abundant, growth-oriented state vs. experiencing contrast that provides clarity.

## Understanding "Above" vs "Below"

### Above the Green Line (80%+ / 28+ points per category)

**Characteristics:**
- Empowered mindset
- Abundance thinking
- Growth-oriented
- Positive energy
- Taking ownership
- Seeing opportunities
- Feeling aligned and free

**Language Examples:**
- "I am creating..."
- "I have choices..."
- "This feels aligned..."
- "I'm moving toward..."

### Below the Green Line (<60% / <21 points per category)

**CRITICAL: This is NOT failure!**

**What It Really Means:**
- Contrast providing clarity
- Awareness opportunities
- Information about what you want to shift
- Valuable feedback for growth
- Natural part of the journey

**Language Examples (user might express):**
- "I struggle with..."
- "I don't have..."
- "I wish I could..."
- "Things feel off..."

**Our Response:**
- Acknowledge the contrast
- Validate their experience
- Help them see what they DO want (flip to positive)
- Use this clarity to build their vision

## Assessment Scoring

- **Scoring Range**: 1-5 per question, 35 max per category
- **Above**: 28-35 points (80-100%)
- **Transitioning**: 21-27 points (60-79%)
- **Below**: <21 points (<60%)

## How We Use This

1. **In Life Vision Creation**: Help users understand areas of contrast and clarity
2. **In Prompts**: Personalized prompts based on Green Line status
3. **In Refinement**: Use Green Line awareness to guide refinements
4. **In Daily Practice**: Track alignment over time

## Key Principles

1. **No Judgment**: Below Green Line is information, not failure
2. **Contrast Creates Clarity**: Use below-Green-Line moments to clarify desires
3. **Present Tense Focus**: Always frame in terms of what IS (even when building from contrast)
4. **Empowerment Language**: Help users shift language from victim to creator

**Core Philosophy:** The Green Line is a tool for awareness and growth, not a judgment of worth or success.
