## Overview

VibrationFit is built around three core operations that help members become conscious creators of their reality.

## The Three Operations

### 1. Active Vision
**Purpose**: Create your "Life I Chooseâ„¢" document

**What It Includes:**
- 12-category life vision document
- Written in present-tense positive activation
- Uses 80%+ of user's own words
- Weaves categories together (life is interconnected)
- Flips negatives to positives
- Created through VIVA-powered flow

**Tools:**
- Life Vision Creation (`/life-vision/new`)
- Vision Refinement (`/life-vision/[id]/refine`)
- Vision Viewing (`/life-vision`)

**Outcome**: A comprehensive vision that helps you feel free just by reading it.

### 2. Consistent Alignment
**Purpose**: Stay vibrationally aligned through daily activation

**What It Includes:**
- Vision Boards (Gallery/grid system with status: active, actualized, inactive)
- Vision Audio (personalized recordings of vision)

- Daily practices and rituals
- VIVA prompts and nudges

**Tools:**
- Vision Board System (`/vision-board`) - Grid/list view with filtering
- Vision Audio Generation (`/life-vision/[id]/audio`)
- Alignment practices

**Outcome**: A personal operating system for staying vibrationally fit.

### 3. Evidence of Actualization
**Purpose**: Capture proof of transformation in real time

**What It Includes:**
- Daily journal entries
- Mood tracking (Above/Below Green Line)

**Tools:**

**Outcome**: A living record that reinforces new identity and proves transformation.

## How They Work Together

1. **Vision** sets the direction
2. **Alignment** maintains the frequency daily
3. **Evidence** proves and reinforces the transformation

All three are necessary for conscious creation to work.

**Core Principle:** These aren't separate tools - they're one integrated system for living a vibrationally aligned life.
