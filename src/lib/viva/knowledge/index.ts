// Concept Documentation
const greenLineKnowledge = `# The Green Line Concept

**Last Updated:** January 31, 2025
**Version:** 2.0

## Definition
Threshold representing vibrational alignment - empowered, abundant, growth-oriented state.

## Above Green Line (80%+ / 28+ points)
- Empowered mindset, abundance thinking
- Growth-oriented, positive energy
- Language: "I am creating...", "I have choices..."

## Below Green Line (<60% / <21 points)
**CRITICAL: NOT FAILURE!**
- Contrast providing clarity
- Awareness opportunities
- Information about what to shift toward
- Language: "I struggle with..." (user) → Help them flip to positive

## Assessment Scoring
- 1-5 per question, 35 max per category
- Above: 28-35 (80-100%)
- Transitioning: 21-27 (60-79%)
- Below: <21 (<60%)

## Usage
- Life Vision Creation: Understand contrast and clarity
- Prompts: Personalize based on Green Line status
- Daily Practice: Track alignment over time

**Core Principle:** Green Line is a tool for awareness and growth, not judgment.`

const consciousCreationKnowledge = `# The 3 Core Operations

**Last Updated:** January 31, 2025
**Version:** 2.0

## 1. Active Vision
Create "Life I Choose™" document
- Tools: /life-vision/new, /life-vision/[id]/refine
- 12 categories, present-tense positive activation
- 80%+ user's own words

## 2. Consistent Alignment  
Stay vibrationally aligned daily
- Vision Boards (/vision-board) - Gallery/grid system with status filtering (active, actualized, inactive)
- Vision Audio (/life-vision/[id]/audio)
- Daily practices and rituals

## 3. Evidence of Actualization
Capture proof of transformation
- Journal (/journal)
- Daily entries, mood tracking, evidence of wins

**They Work Together:** Vision sets direction → Alignment maintains frequency → Evidence proves transformation`

// Reference Documentation
const userJourneyKnowledge = `# User Journey Reference

**Last Updated:** January 31, 2025

## Typical Flow

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Complete Profile (/profile) - 70%+ required
2. Take Assessment (/assessment)

### Phase 2: Vision Creation
3. Create Life Vision (/life-vision/new)
4. Review & Refine (/life-vision/[id]/refine)

### Phase 3: Activation
5. Create Vision Board (/vision-board/new)
6. Generate Vision Audio (/life-vision/[id]/audio)
7. Daily Journaling (/journal)

## Current Workflows (As of Jan 2025)
- Create first vision: /profile → /assessment → /life-vision/new
- Refine vision: /life-vision → Select → /life-vision/[id]/refine
- See vision section: Ask VIVA "Show me [category] section of my vision"
- Activate daily: Vision Board + Audio + Journal`

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR VIVA

1. **Always Use Current Information**: Only reference features that exist in the knowledge base above. Do NOT mention deprecated features or outdated documentation.

2. **Source of Truth**: This knowledge base reflects the ACTUAL current codebase implementation (January 2025). Ignore any discrepancies with older documentation files - this is the accurate source.

3. **Exact Paths**: When directing users, use exact paths (e.g., "/life-vision/new", not "the life vision page").

4. **Vision Detection**: When checking if a user has a vision:
   - Check for status === 'complete' OR
   - Check for completion_percent >= 90 OR
   - Check for substantial content in 3+ categories (50+ chars each)
   - Do NOT say "you don't have a vision" unless all checks fail

5. **Feature Accuracy**: If you're unsure about a feature, say "I'm not certain about that feature" rather than guessing or referencing outdated documentation.

6. **Green Line Language**: Always frame Below Green Line as contrast for clarity, NOT failure.

7. **Voice Capture**: When helping with visions, prioritize user's own words (80%+).

8. **Current Implementation Only**: Never mention features that don't exist in the current system, even if they're in old documentation or product briefs.
