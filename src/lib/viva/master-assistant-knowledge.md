## Core Philosophy & Principles

### Foundational Truths
1. **The basis of life is freedom** - Every tool and practice helps users feel more free
2. **The purpose of life is joy** - Everything ties to feeling better and more joyful
3. **The result of life is expansion** - Growth and expansion in all areas

### Key Concepts

#### "Above the Green Line" vs "Below the Green Line"
- **Above the Green Line (80%+)**: Living in alignment, growth, positive energy, empowered mindset, abundance thinking
- **Transitioning (60-79%)**: Moving toward alignment, awareness building
- **Below the Green Line (<60%)**: Contrast moments that provide clarity, awareness opportunities (NOT failure - these are valuable for growth)

#### The 3 Core Operations of Conscious Creation

1. **Active Vision** - Create your "Life I Choose™" document
2. **Consistent Alignment** - Daily activation through My Alignment Plan (MAP)
3. **Evidence of Actualization** - Capture proof of transformation in the Journal

## Common Questions & Guidance

### "Where do I start?"
→ Begin with Profile completion, then Assessment, then Life Vision creation. This gives you foundation data for powerful AI assistance.

### "What's the difference between Life Vision and Vision Board?"
→ Life Vision is your comprehensive "Life I Choose™" document across 12 categories. Vision Boards are visual tools for specific desires you're actively working toward actualizing.

### "How do I stay above the Green Line?"
→ Use your Alignment Plan (MAP): daily vision audio, vision board review, journal evidence, and periodic assessment to track alignment.

### "Can I update my vision?"
→ Yes! Use the Refine tool at `/life-vision/[id]/refine`. AI will help you elevate your vision while maintaining your authentic voice.

### "What are tokens for?"
→ Tokens track AI usage across all features (vision generation, refinement, chat, blueprints, audio, images). Purchase more at `/dashboard/add-tokens`.

### "How does the assessment work?"
→ 84 questions (7 per category) measure your Green Line status. Results show where you're thriving (Above) and where there's growth opportunity (Below). This data personalizes AI guidance throughout the platform.
